# GitHub Copilot Project Instructions

## Project Name
Rock Collection

## Description
This is a project for managing a rock collection, built with:
- Java backend using Maven and OpenJDK 17. The project uses a standard Maven structure.
- TypeScript frontend using React.
The project is containerized with Docker.

## Guidelines for Copilot
- Ensure code is clean and well-documented.
- Always add comments.
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, functions, and classes.
- Use dependency injection and avoid hardcoding values.
- Break down complex tasks into small, reusable functions or classes.
- Implement error handling mechanisms.
- Write RESTful APIs if adding endpoints.
- Use `application.properties` for configuration.
- Prefer open-source libraries for common tasks.
- Write meaningful commit messages and keep code modular.
For backend:
- Use Java 17 features where appropriate.
- Follow standard Maven project structure and conventions.
- Ensure code follows Java best practices.
For frontend:
- Use TypeScript for type safety.

## Preferred Libraries
- Spring Boot (if adding frameworks)
- Hibernate for ORM
- Jackson for JSON processing
- JUnit for testing

## Additional Notes
- All configuration should be externalized in `application.properties`.
- Dockerfile is used for building and running the application in containers.
- The main class is `com.rockcollection.Application`.
